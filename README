-- DATASETS

Shuffled dataset examples are presented in 100obs_testset branch. Full dataset examples are presented in the Raw-Full-Data branch, including all of the available features.

The remaining participant datasets will be uploaded if the paper is accepted.

There are 38 datasets in total. 

The datasets titled 'participant_X_100obs..' refer to data that has been processed such that an observation is taken every 100 frames. 

-- USED SETS

The training set used was participant 1-27. The validation set was 28-30. The test set was 31-38.

The test set presented is already shuffled, so using the last 10 observations of this set the next observation can be predicted with the model supplied.

The data was scaled using participants 1-27 data. This scaling is then applied on the input data to prepare for input into the network.

-- MAPPINGS

0 = X coordinate, 1 = Y coordinate, 2 = Current Lap, 3 = Current Speed, 4 = Acceleration

-- MODELS

Additional models (300 and 600 obs) will be made available if the paper is successful.

The '100obs_xysa' model has been trained on given parameters x, y, speed, and acceleration. NOTE: Lap is not used as an input the model.
